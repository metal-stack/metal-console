# Metal Console

Metal Console provides access to the serial console of metal devices.
This is achieved by acting as a bridge between ssh and the console protocol of the concrete device.
It will support either libvirt based console access, which is used in the development environment.
On real hardware ipmi based lanserv sol (Serial Over LAN) will be used.

To access the console execute:

```bash

ssh -i <private key> <uuid of the device>@<hostname of metal-console server>

```

The metal-console will then lookup the given username as device uuid on metal-api, request which console protocol to use.
If the device uuid is a valid device, it will then use the provided private key to authenticate against the ssh public key 
stored in the metal-api for this device. If access is granted, the user will have access to the console.
